An intelligent walking route planning App based on LLM (Large Language Model) + AmAP API.
It understands natural language requirements (both Chinese and English), automatically retrieves nearby POIs (place/store names), generates appropriate walking routes, and visualizes them in a map. The placeholder ability to return the number of steps in a week is also supported to facilitate subsequent docking of health data.
